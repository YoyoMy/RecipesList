# RecipesList - My first Android app  Created for AND1 VIA UC.  
Recipes List (still in the proccess of creating a more interesting name) is an app which allows users to view and add new recipes. It will help people decide what to cook next.  
The users will also be able to track their calories intake as well as monitor their macros, since the recipes will contain the nutritional values per portion.  
  
Reasoning:  
I love cooking. But I alsi want to keep in shape. Therefore, apart from having workouts every day I also keep track of my calories intake and my meals macros. 
I have calculated that for my goal I have to eat approximately 1200kals per day. I also have to cut down the fat and increase the protein in my diet. 
That makes it hard sometimes to come up with an idea on what to cook. 
Hense the idea of this app.
