# RecipesList - My first Android app  Created for AND1 VIA UC.  
Recipes List (still in the proccess of creating a more interesting name) is an app which allows users to view and add new recipes. It will help people decide what to cook next.  
The users will also be able to track their calories intake as well as monitor their macros, since the recipes will contain the nutritional values per portion.
