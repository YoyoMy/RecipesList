# RecipesList - My first Android app  
Created for AND1 VIA UC.  
Recipes List (still in the proccess of creating a more interesting name) is an app which allows users to view and add new recipes. It will help people decide what to cook next.  
The users will also be able to track their calories intake as well as monitor their macros, since the recipes will contain the nutritional values per portion.  
  
Reasoning:  
I love cooking. But I also want to keep in shape. Therefore, apart from having workouts every day I also keep track of my calories intake and my meals macros. 
I have calculated that for my goal I have to eat approximately 1200kals per day. I also have to cut down the fat and increase the protein in my diet. 
That makes it hard sometimes to come up with an idea on what to cook. 
Hense the idea for this app.

Reading the user stories at the end of the semester, I was way too ambitios for an app, that I am working on my own for only a couple of month and learning Android at the same time :) Nevertheless, I am quite proud of the current state of the project. Would definitely improve it in the future.
